    terminal.init(); //Initialise the terminal and allow three basic commands
    terminal.setFileExtensions([web_pages_extensions_seprated_by_comma_such_as_html_jsp]); //Which kind of extensions your web pages are using to navigate through webpages

eg=>
let terminal = new Terminal("Terminal/Vedant::", "textarea");
    terminal.init(); //Initialise the terminal and allow three basic commands
    terminal.setFileExtensions([web_pages_extensions_seprated_by_comma_such_as_html_jsp]); //Which kind of extensions your web pages are using to navigate through webpages

```

## Usage

1. In a webpage it will open a terminal Like UI
2. This terminal take styles from the styles.json, So you can fully customize the UI as your need ðŸ™‚
3. All the commands are stored in commands.json files
4. Make sure that you are passing all the extensions of view files
```

## Commands

1. To navigate through web pages. You can use cd file_name_with_extension_or_without_extension
   E.g=>

```java
cd index2 or cd index2.html  //This will take you to index2.html
```

2. To navigate through divs of same page, You can use goto div_id //Classes wont work use Id as its unique
   E.g=>

```java

## Contributing

- Please share your ideas to make this even better. I am expecting all the good and bad suggestions and also I will appriciate if you help to extend the functionality.

## Some Precuations

- Start development or local server before embedding this terminal as it works on fetch api it will need developmnet server else you will get error.
- To change any UI related functionality I will suggest that you should keep it in JSON format and fetch it inside the project.
- As It has ID of "Terminal" and IDs are unique you should keep in the mind that only one terminal can be displayed on one page.
- Put all the files in one folderðŸ˜….This is really important
